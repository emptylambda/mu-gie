## μgie: Intemediate Verification Testing

### What is μgie? (pronounced: "moo-gie") 

μgie is a tool which inputs a seed [Boogie program](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) 
and generates a collection of mutant programs, each with a slight mutation twist from
original seed. This tool is developed with the goal of stress-testing overall brittleness of program verifiers. 

The mutations DO NOT introduce any semantical change
to the underlying seed but merely explore syntatical variants of the
seed, think of it as a "thesaursus" for your Boogie programs.

<!-- As a by-product, you can also use μgie to generate arbitrarily big benchmark for your verifiers, provided a suitable Boogie interface -->

### Usage: 
TBD 

### Current mutations: 
TBD

### Benchmark programs: 
TBD 

### Gallery of mutants: 
TBD

### Headers: 
Each mutant generated by μgie comes with a header, loggind down basic
information of this mutant. Most importantly, we can have a closer
look at the mutation history---the overall mutations μgie applied---of
this mutant.
