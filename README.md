## μgie: lightweight testing on [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie)
μgie provides a lightweight testing on the popular intermediate verification language Boogie. 
We call this idea the _robustness testing_ on IVLs.  
By introducing syntactical variants (which should not impose any semantical change), μgie generates a collection of mutants from the input seed program.  
The goal of mutating the original seed Boogie program is to exercise possible language variants of Boogie, and to further explore brittle behaviours of deductive verification systems.
